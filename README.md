# Customer Churn Prediction System
An interactive web application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow that predicts customer churn probability for a banking institution. This system uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze customer data and identify customers at risk of leaving.

## Features
-**Real-time Predictions**: Instantly calculate churn probability based on customer attributes

-**Interactive Interface: User**-friendly Streamlit interface with sliders, dropdowns, and number inputs

-**Comprehensive Data Processing**: Automated encoding and scaling of categorical/numerical features

-**Model Interpretability**: Clear probability output with binary classification (churn/not churn)

-**Production Ready**: Complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model inference
